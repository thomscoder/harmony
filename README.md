# Harmony

Quickly upload, create, open, read, modify and download files in the browser (no remote server).

Harmony implements via WebAssembly a virtual file system in Go (a revisited version of my <a href="https://github.com/thomscoder/nova" target="_blank">Nova</a> project) where all the file operations happen. 

Either upload or create one or multiple new files, double click to open and start modifying, copy the entire file content in one click.

Simply refresh the page to restart anew.
