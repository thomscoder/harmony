# Harmony

Quickly upload, create, open, read, modify and download files in the browser (no remote server).

Harmony implements via WebAssembly a virtual file system in Go (a revisited version of my <a href="https://github.com/thomscoder/nova-git" target="_blank">Nova</a> project) where all the file operations happen. 

Either upload or create one or multiple new files, double click to open and start modifying, copy the entire file content in one click.
